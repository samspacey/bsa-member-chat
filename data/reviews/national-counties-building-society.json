After speaking to Tracy today she sorted everything out for us.  Tracy knew what she was talking about, she was very helpful, friendly and took the time to allow me to work through the process of completing our registration whilst she stayed on the phone to make sure it worked correctly.  She talked about my options and what we wanted to do.  Unfortunately we have closed the Bond but this is only due to the fact our car has been written off and we may need some of the money to purchase a new one.  Once I know how much we have left we will be more than happy to re-invest with yourselves.",

These included full name, account number, first line of address, postcode, date of birth, National Insurance number, and occupation.\n\nI have never known a financial organisation to require seven security questions, nor to provide such a poor online and telephone setup.

Having then gained online access to the account I was asked to check my profile details and so needed to change my mobile telephone number.  After several failed attempts, i.e. no response after clicking the \"confirm\" button, I again had to telephone FBS.  After a lengthy call, and even then only after  consultation with another colleague to get round the problem, was the agent able to input the new number from his end.  This is a joint account so it seems that my wife also needs to go through this whole time consuming and frustrating process if she is to access the account.  It will be far far easier for me to close the account and transfer the money to another provider.  Do the writers of these online websites ever check that their programs work before they are forced on the customer?
