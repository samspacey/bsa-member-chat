However they have no ceiling rate, so when the interest rates went up exponentially, there was nothing to protect their members. They therefore design their products to protect themselves alone. Potential customers should also know that for a long time preferential rates were offered to new members at the expense of existing members. Should a mutual building Society behave this way? Their mortgage products are all smoke and mirrors, a maze of early repayment fees, product fees, floor rates, set up so that their members will always be disadvantaged. I read the following today: \"Monmouthshire Building Society has today (August 20th) published its financial results for 2024-25. The Newport-based Society has announced a 61% increase in profits for the last financial year, up from £2.3million, to £3.7million, and total assets reaching £1.72bn.\" Well it's no wonder. There's only ever going to be profits for the building society which plays heads I win, tails you lose. If you're looking for a fair building society which operates for the benefit of its members, don't look at the Monmouthshire.",

We have suffered extraordinarily difficult circumstances and they have and still are declining to offer us any meaningful help. Do not trust them. Do not believe their advertisements 'We are a mutual building society run for the benefit of our members'. This could not be further from the truth. Despite many requests they will not even meet us in person, which is a strange way to 'benefit' us. They are not reducing their interest rates as the Bank of England have done because in their words “As a Building Society we can increase or decrease our SVR at any time, and we do not need to follow the movement in the Bank of England Base Rate. This basically means that they can and are quite prepared to ruin their members. They have behaved so badly towards us that it beggars belief. Their complaints procedure is utterly pointless. Despite stating that they agreed with one of our complaints, they still were 'unable to uphold' it for an utterly nonsensical reason which has no correlation to the complaint. The complaints procedure is a box ticking exercise designed solely for them to appear to be fulfilling their obligations. Above all else, remember that the Monmouthshire Building Society are money lenders who, just like all other money lenders, are in it for themselves and themselves alone. They are causing us catastrophic financial ruin which was completely avoidable and the bottom line is they do not care. Even if you are critically vulnerable, they do not care. They should be utterly ashamed of themselves.",

They have been flexible as we’ve added to the loan or reduced it, and as we’ve altered the borrowing length as our needs have changed. They have been easy to talk to despite our living quite away from the nearest branch, and the interest rates have always been competitive. I would recommend the Monmouthshire Building Society to anyone looking for services they provide.",

He was there whenever we needed to speak to him and he made the whole process so much easier. The bank gave us a great deal as we were already customers so all in all it was a calm and clear process with no problems whatsoever even though we had an unusual request. Highly recommend them.",
