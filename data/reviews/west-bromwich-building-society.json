      "text": "West Brom BS have just mailed out to me an 11-page glossy booklet and 6 sheets of A4 paper in the post. One sheet has nothing but the BS logo plastered on to it and the standard regularity blurb etc. Acres of room for both exist within the covering letter ... ergo, one sheet is a pointless waste. \n\nAll this paper is generated by the end of a 12-month online Regular Saver (Issue 7) at a fixed rate of 6%, which will auto transfer/renew at maturity into an new 'Access Regular Saver' at a derisory 2.10 % variable rate of interest (from 03.02.26). Vote with your feet when your fixed rate 6% Regular Saver is up and shift the maturity money to something so much better.\n\nFor balance, there is a decent Regular Saver in the West  Brom 'savings stable' but it is strictly a branch-based application; a product, by default, reserved for the chosen few that can actually get to one.   One could, if one where in the line of such speculation, venture to suggest that decision does not appear to align with the broader membership's interests. \n\nWB's promised digital overhaul - partnered with 10x banking and Deloitte's -  has the potential to be transformative. It is to be hoped that WB might also want to re-visit some core mutual values at the same time. However, with a 61 % 1-star rating as of the time of posting, I have not yet left the 'hope' stage ...",

Firstly they rejected a transfer request they \"did not receive\" because on the banking details the word Websave appeared (beware of this, which WBBS say is a \"common error\" causing delays). It then transpired that WBBS is not even on the banking system other than for \"websave\" accounts so it is easy to select the websave option when there is no other standard banking protocol for WBBS. I then completed 2 more forms of which I was told they \"have no record\" although my new ISA provider confirmed they had emailed them over. The latest of these has also been rejected because it contains a digital signature...it was a digital form which I had to send to my new ISA provider digitally! It really is time this outfit came into the 21st century. All the time losing interest and risking the transfer not being completed within the funding deadline for the new ISA, I now have to wait for WBBS to write to me and for me to return a form by post. I am extremely dissatisfied by these outdated policies.",

I therefore applied for a portal of orginal Morgage sorely under myself and then to add my partner on and borrow extra for the property we had seen. We were given two principle of agreements. We then went through application to be told because my partner has bad credit/defaults we could not proceed. \nI completely understood this so asked if I could proceed solely again on the extra borrowing. The affordability was no problem given I had since had a substantial pay increase. \nHowever, this is now my complaint, I was told I could proceed because I’d already applied with my partner. To which I answered I know all of this but I’m now solely wanting the Morgage as I have done the last 2.5 years. I have been refused because “policy” states I had applied jointly first. If I’d have know this prior I would have just applied and had got the extra solely. \nI’m livid as now I’m having to go with another company who has now accepted my application but I have to pay the redemption fee of £4000 because of a policy which in legal terms is not a stance. This is just someone in the company following a part policy which actually makes no sense. \nDO NOT USE WEST BROM. Your loyalty and customer service is none existent to them. \nTo top it off their customer service and complaints will be informed by the advisor which will take 28 days or 56 for complaints procedure. By which time I am needing to proceed as we have a chain of people all waiting to move on. \nI advised that waiting this time by which I will only receive the standard apology letter doesn’t quite help or problem solve this issue. An apology also doesn’t quite cut it when I’m dealing with life like everyone else work, children and going through cancer treatment. \nThe kick in the teeth is the £4000 that they will also get back because of a statement on a policy. \nWhoever is dealing with your internal policies and guidance needs to have a major look at what you are doing to people and also look at equitable guidelines. That’s just what they are guidelines! \nI wonder if the would be kind enough to waiver the £4000 for being so incompetent, inconsistent in the guidelines and appalling customer service to loyal customers.",

What a bloody joke of a building society you are West Brom & I’m actually pleased you turned me down because I will take my £150k to a proper building society now. Your loss",

Fast forward 3 days later....letter received (shame they never mentioned this in the very beginning prior to requesting that I fund the account!!) and I get an email stating that my nominated account has been \"approved\".Fast forward 14 days and still no refund on the rejected payment,nothing heard from WestBrom so I fire off an internal message direct from my WebSave account....no acknowledgment,no response...NOTHING !! I rechecked everything as I began to think I'd lost the plot ,I checked all the original account numbers,all was exactly as requested by WestBrom,so as a test I sent another nominal amount (£1) .... nothing showing for days in my WebSave account,then I receive an email again requesting that I fund the account AGAIN !!!! By this time I'm starting to lose the will to live & bitterly regretting my choice of savings account,today I received another rejected payment & that this was again stated because it wasn't from my nominated bank account (it is from my nominated account....I checked yet again!!!).I sent another nominal £1 only this time putting in my actual WebSave account no in the reference field rather than the application reference which is what WestBroms original payment request email told me to do.....I am literally FLABERGASTED at the sheer incompetence of this useless & utterly shambollic 'Building Society'......the lack of customer service on ANY level speaks volumes and thankfully my initial payments are small (thankfully!) ....Can you imagine how I'd be feeling right now if I'd deposited a couple of thousand as my initial payment & it just disappears into the ether....??

I’m now left stranded and worried my kid won’t be able to start at his primary school in September.

They were quite happy to see an account potentially fall into arrears and face the threat of repossession. Having spoken to several mortgage advisors whom we’re all of the opinion that The West Brom should be able to offer a period of interest only repayments or to switch onto another product mid-term, I contacted them to request the same, which was abruptly rejected, with no logical reasoning behind their decision.

And, when you need the money back, the same thing happens; it disappears from your account with them but doesn’t materialise with the payee until days have elapsed and you’re worried witless. And don’t think about calling them to complain, it’s like their staff ad was for the worst idiot in the village. If a group of dunderheads had opened a building society, is it.
