I think the bank and scheme is fantastic, and having the 25% bonus removed if you withdraw money is a great way to never spend it. It’s also very easy to navigate, on the website and on the app. I trust this company, having found all the legal paperwork easy to understand with no catch. Due to my recommendations my family have also opened LISA’s with this bank. This service is opening doors for people that normally would’ve never been able to afford a house.",

Regrettably I have recommended 2 of my friends to use the Nottingham (this was before the problems started) and they have also experienced issues. One of them went to the bank instead after being messed around with proofs and the other is battling through. The only positive is they have no fees and one of the case handlers (Shaz) is about the only person who follows up when they say they will or completes anything in a prompt time frame.

Luckily, I have a friend who is a doctor so was able to get this done free of charge. Forms were all sent via snail mail which defeats the object of an online account. Hence, this took days rather than the minutes when amending details on a laptop. Forms also failed to arrive. I've asked them to close the account now. So, the 'instant' access has taken almost a month now. Oh, and they manged to leave a £1000 of mine in a 'suspended' account which made me even more frantic as I'd thought it had been lost. What is more, while they do pick up the phone quickly, you are then left on hold for 5-10 minutes which is far too long when you're paying for the call.",
