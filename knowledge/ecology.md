## Community & Values

### Environmental Mission
Ecology's core purpose is "to improve the environment and society by enabling sustainable buildings and communities." Every loan must demonstrate consistency with their Environmental Policy Statement.

**Vision:** "To support the creation of a fair society in a sustainable world" — measured against three outcomes:
1. People and the environment benefit from homes with good ecological performance
2. People and the environment benefit from sustainable communities
3. People and the environment benefit from a fair and sustainable economy

### What They Fund
- Eco self-builds (including non-standard: straw bale, hempcrete, rammed earth, timber frame, cob)
- Energy-saving renovations and retrofits
- Conversions of derelict/disused buildings
- Co-housing and community-led housing
- Housing co-operatives and associations
- Community Land Trusts
- Charities and community groups
- Smallholdings and small woodlands
- Sustainable businesses
- Organic farming

### What They Don't Fund
- Fossil fuels
- Mining companies
- The arms trade
- Deforestation
- Gambling

### Accreditations & Awards
- Ethical Consumer Best Buy (mortgages and savings) — ethiscore 100%
- Fair Tax Mark (first building society, 2016)
- BSA member
- Bank.Green recommended
- Net zero journey — sharing learnings with members, colleagues, and peers
- Supporter of the Nature Bill

## Key Differentiators

1. **Only UK building society dedicated entirely to ecological/sustainable lending** — every mortgage must demonstrate environmental or social benefit
2. **C-Change discount system** — unique lifetime mortgage rate discounts (up to 1.50%) based on energy performance achieved, rewarding borrowers for building/improving energy efficiency
3. **Specialist in unusual/non-standard projects** — will consider projects mainstream lenders reject (straw bale, hempcrete, woodland, derelict conversions, community housing)
4. **Complete ethical transparency** — clear negative screening (no fossil fuels, arms, mining, deforestation, gambling) and positive screening (all lending supports sustainability)
5. **Mutual ownership with genuine member engagement** — well-attended AGMs, member meet-ups at unusual venues, members actively shape the business
6. **Human-first service** — UK-based staff, no call queues or phone bots, personal approach consistently praised
7. **Heat pump cashback** — additional financial incentive for renewable heating installation
8. **Fair Tax Mark holder** — first building society to achieve this
9. **100% Ethical Consumer ethiscore** — top rating across all ethical criteria
10. **Community-led housing expertise** — leading lender for co-housing, Community Land Trusts, housing co-ops, and mutual home ownership
11. **Small but growing rapidly** — assets up 49% in 5 years, staff nearly doubled, ambitious 2030 Strategy with major tech transformation underway
12. **Variable rates only** — all mortgages are variable rate (SVR or discounted variable), no fixed-rate products — simpler but may deter rate-conscious borrowers

## Specific Customer Reviews

**Overall ratings:** Trustpilot 4.5/5 (41 reviews) | Smart Money People 4.91/5 (669 reviews)

### Positive - Straw bale house mortgage
> "I approached Ecology Building Society nine years ago for a mortgage to build a straw bale house and have been with them ever since, moving my savings over as well. I love the fact they support people like me to build their dreams in a green and natural way."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Source:** Trustpilot
- **Date:** August 2025
- **Context:** Self-builder got a mortgage for an unconventional eco build that mainstream lenders wouldn't touch. Became a long-term savings customer too.

### Positive - Land purchase for tree planting
> "This company is a true representation of how businesses should endeavour to help people to look after the planet. They offered me a mortgage, despite my age, to help with the purchase of land for planting trees. Such faith in the restoration of the English countryside for the next generation. Priceless!"
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Source:** Trustpilot
- **Date:** December 2024
- **Context:** Older borrower given a mortgage for land purchase specifically for tree planting — a highly unusual lending proposition that most societies wouldn't consider.

### Positive - Housing co-op mortgage over 20 years
> "Our housing co-op took a mortgage with Ecology Building Society almost 20 years ago. A man called Jon sorted it out for us. We're now building 29 new houses and need a new mortgage — guess what? Jon has sorted it for us."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Source:** Smart Money People
- **Date:** March 2022
- **Context:** Long-standing relationship with a housing co-op, same dedicated staff member handling their account across two decades. Shows personal service and community housing expertise.

### Positive - Barn conversion dream home
> "When we went for a mortgage with the bank we use for all our banking, one that says it supports people like us — farmers wanting to build a home and going that extra mile for us — and then they turned us down. And so did all the other normal banks, just because our barn conversion was a little unique and different. It was Ecology who gave us a mortgage and made our dream come true. It was easy and simple and more importantly sensible. Just common sense!"
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Source:** Smart Money People
- **Date:** March 2022
- **Context:** Farmers rejected by mainstream banks for a barn conversion. Ecology took a common-sense approach to a project others saw as too unusual.

### Positive - 450-year-old house rescue
> "The Ecology supports the sympathetic preservation of old buildings and granted a mortgage on our 450-year-old home after a major building society withdrew its offer at the last minute on questionable grounds."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Source:** Smart Money People
- **Date:** April 2021
- **Context:** Heritage property purchase where another building society pulled out at the last minute. Ecology stepped in for an extremely old property.

### Positive - Community house loan
> "The Ecology Building Society provided a large loan for us to buy back half of a historic building that has been home to a changing community over 50 years. We have a social and environmental approach to sharing while we also all get on with our own lives. A grand house built for a rich family has been home to up to 19 people of all ages and backgrounds at a time. Without the Ecology we could not have done this."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Source:** Smart Money People
- **Date:** March 2022
- **Context:** Community living group buying back part of a historic shared house. Shows Ecology's willingness to lend for alternative living arrangements.

### Positive - Best ethical bank search
> "I was looking for an ethical bank that is transparent about where it invests my money and only invests it into companies and/or projects that are good for the planet and communities, and Ecology came out top. The process of joining was smooth and all done digitally/via photos of paper documents... The only criticism I have is I would really like them to be a bigger company with high street branches, debit cards and an app, so that I could move all of my banking over to them."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Source:** Trustpilot
- **Date:** October 2025
- **Context:** Detailed review from an ethically-motivated saver. Praises transparency and digital onboarding but wishes they offered full banking services.

### Positive - 40-year savings member
> "I've been saving with Ecology Building Society for 40 years. I really like that they were 'green' before it was trendy and they haven't watered down their values. It's great to talk to a real human being on the phone if I need to and the staff have always been friendly and efficient."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Source:** Trustpilot
- **Date:** July 2025
- **Context:** One of the longest-serving members, saving since near the society's founding in 1981. Values their consistency and human customer service.

### Positive - 20-year saver, Yorkshire pride
> "I've been with the Ecology for over 20 years, and always glad to be a customer. One of the very few financial institutions that has a genuinely ethical and responsible approach. No gimmicks or special offers, just simple savings products with decent interest rates. In the past, the online banking was cumbersome, but it's now fine. So good to know your money is supporting other people who need loans to buy, build and renovate properties, rather than going to pay banker bonuses. Also a small company based here in Yorkshire, so what is not to like."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Source:** Smart Money People
- **Date:** June 2025
- **Context:** Long-term saver who acknowledges past online banking issues but says they've improved. Values the simplicity and ethical investment of savings.

### Positive - Self-build eco home
> "We needed a self-build mortgage for an unusual house built to high thermal efficiency standards. Elsewhere was often 'computer says no'. Ecology took the time to understand the concept and then couldn't have been more helpful. Great people, great philosophy. All lenders are not equal!"
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Source:** Smart Money People
- **Date:** March 2022
- **Context:** Self-builder with a high-spec eco home that mainstream lenders rejected automatically. Ecology's manual underwriting approach was the differentiator.

### Positive - Self-build finance support
> "They were the only Building Society that would finance our unusual eco project and provided support and took an interest right through to completion. We were invited to present our project to other members at their AGM in order to help those members in their own projects... They provided finance up front which meant that we didn't have to get a bridging loan which is common practice for self-builders."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Source:** Smart Money People
- **Date:** April 2021
- **Context:** Self-builders who received upfront finance (avoiding bridging loans) and were later invited to present at the AGM. Shows community engagement beyond just lending.

### Negative - Mortgage application nightmare
> "If you value your sanity avoid this mortgage provider. They state on their website that they will lend to more unusual builds — this is not true. They are the most incompetent company I have ever had the misfortune to come across. They take at least 14 days to answer emails, lose emails, employ incompetent surveyors and string you along for months only to decline on a technicality that was not even correct."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Source:** Trustpilot
- **Date:** February 2024
- **Context:** Frustrated mortgage applicant for an unusual build — the very type Ecology markets itself for. Complained about very slow email responses (14+ days), lost communications, and eventual decline after months.

### Negative - Repeated paperwork and timeout
> "Avoid this company at all costs. They string you along for months, take ages to reply, then ask for the same paperwork over and over and finally say you've been timed out and you will have to reapply and pay and do it all over again."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Source:** Trustpilot
- **Date:** August 2025
- **Context:** Applicant experienced extremely slow processing, repeated document requests, and was ultimately told to start over. Ecology responded saying they couldn't find the person in their records.

### Negative - Account setup bureaucracy
> "My daughter tried to set up an account with Ecology, and ended up not bothering. They wanted her to send her passport and driving licence to them in the post as they claimed they had not been certified, which she refused to do. Bizarre company with bad practices and what seems like an age to get any sort of reply from them."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Source:** Trustpilot
- **Date:** April 2025
- **Context:** Prospective saver's daughter abandoned the application due to requirement to post original ID documents. Ecology acknowledged this and said they're working on more digital options.

### Negative - Slow application processing
> "I applied, via my account, for a regular saver. I thought that as an existing member my application would sail through and be available immediately, or the next day, as is the norm for most building societies. Wrong — after waiting a week I had to phone up to enquire about the application, and was informed it is still sitting on the system and had not been actioned."
- **Rating:** 2/5
- **Source:** Trustpilot
- **Date:** March 2024
- **Context:** Existing member frustrated by week-long delay to open a simple additional savings account, plus need for paper signature. Titled review "Snails move faster."

### Negative - Misleading mortgage process
> "Misleading application process, lack of updates, unprofessional customer service. Waste of time."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Source:** Smart Money People
- **Date:** December 2023
- **Context:** Mortgage applicant who felt misled about the process. Brief but the only 1-star mortgage review on Smart Money People out of 99 reviews.

### Negative - Phone manner and discrimination concern
> "I called and the individual who answered came across incredibly entitled. Throwing acronyms at me which I had to request a definition for. When I asked for self-build requirements, I was asked almost immediately whether I was a British citizen. Sure, I may have an accent but really is this the way you provide requirements? I left the call feeling dismissed and angry."
- **Rating:** 2/5
- **Source:** Trustpilot
- **Date:** November 2023
- **Context:** Prospective self-build borrower felt the citizenship question was prompted by their accent. Left feeling the interaction may have been discriminatory. Raised concerns about jargon-heavy communication.
