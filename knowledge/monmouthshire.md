## Specific Customer Reviews

*Source: uk.trustpilot.com/review/monbs.com — collected February 2026. Monmouthshire is rated "Poor" (2.7/5) on Trustpilot with 102 reviews, though branch experiences are overwhelmingly praised while the app draws heavy criticism.*

### Positive - Fantastic first experience with personal touch at Caerleon Road (Trustpilot)
> "The staff from start to finish were professional, friendly and just so helpful. Felt we had the personal touch which is so rare these days. Leighton and Emma at your Caerleon Rd branch were a credit to the company. Thankyou Leighton and Emma."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** New customer's first experience with MBS. Named two specific staff members at the Caerleon Road branch. Highlights the personal touch as rare and valued.

### Positive - David at Swansea branch goes beyond expectations (Trustpilot)
> "David is professional, polite and goes beyond what would be expected of a member of the team at the Swansea branch."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** Short but heartfelt praise for a named staff member at Swansea. Reflects the relationship-driven service model that smaller societies are known for.

### Positive - Outstanding service at Cardiff Queen Street (Trustpilot)
> "The staff at the Cardiff Queen St branch were extremely friendly and helpful getting my issue resolved quickly. A massive thank you to them!"
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** Branch staff resolved an issue quickly. Cardiff Queen Street is one of MBS's key urban branches — positive experience in the capital city.

### Positive - Walked in without appointment, seen immediately (Trustpilot)
> "Attended without an appointment and they managed to fit me in. Very courteous and professional."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** Walk-in customer was accommodated immediately — highlights the flexibility and accessibility of small building society branches vs appointment-only banking at larger institutions.

### Positive - Branch colleague Muss praised for great advice (Trustpilot)
> "Seen immediately in branch by Muss who was excellent and gave great advice, very professional. Great service as usual from the Monmouthshire."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** Repeat customer ("as usual") names specific staff member. Pattern of naming individual employees reflects the personal relationships MBS branch staff build.

### Positive - Still on the high street when others have left (Trustpilot)
> "Helpful staff and speaking to someone in person."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** Brief review titled "Still on the High Street" — values that MBS maintains a physical branch presence. For many customers, simply being able to speak to someone face-to-face is the primary value proposition.

### Negative - 6% savings rate useless when the app won't let you open an account (Trustpilot)
> "Having found that the MBS offered 6% in their savings account two days ago, I downloaded the app as it's app only. I entered all the details yet when I submitted my linked bank details, the app stated it was unable to verify my account. I called them and was told they were experiencing app issues and so try again later in the day. I've tried no less than seven times since by uninstalling the app and reinstalling. Each time, after entering most of my details, it stalled on the bank verification stage. Two days after being told my account is open, the app is still saying 'Getting things ready'. The app is broken and I've decided to give up and close the account."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** Customer attracted by competitive 6% regular saver rate but completely unable to open the account due to persistent app failures. Tried 7+ times. Initially upgraded to 3 stars when a staff member helped manually, but downgraded back to 1 when the app still wouldn't work days later.

### Negative - App unable to verify bank accounts after three attempts (Trustpilot)
> "Having read other reviews I can see this building society doesn't score well. On a regular savings application my linked account was rejected prompting me to phone in. The agent didn't know the reason for the rejection. The app didn't allow me to retry with another account, the advice was to delete, reinstall and go through all the rigmarole again."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** New customer experienced the same bank verification failure pattern. Call centre agent couldn't explain why. App didn't allow retry — had to fully reinstall and re-enter everything.

### Negative - Failed three times to open account, compared to easy experience at other societies (Trustpilot)
> "Tried 3 times to open a regular savers account. The app was unable to verify any of my 3 bank accounts. I have online accounts with Cumberland, Leeds, Coventry, Principality, West Brom, Nationwide building societies and have had no difficulty in opening accounts with them or had any issues with accessing my accounts. MBS should have a look at their systems and maybe learn something from them."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Date:** November 2025
- **Context:** Customer explicitly compared MBS unfavourably to six other building societies where account opening worked first time. Devastating comparison that highlights MBS's digital gap.

### Negative - App crashes constantly, frozen on 2FA page (Trustpilot)
> "After being less than complimentary about the appalling app a few months back, I deleted it and thought I'd give MBS some time to sort it out. I reinstalled it yesterday after over a month, logged in a few times, then today it's crashed again and is frozen on the 2FA page. What I don't understand is why you are not fixing it MBS. You know the app hasn't been fit for purpose for so many months. Get an expert in to fix it!"
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Date:** November 2025
- **Context:** Returning customer gave MBS a second chance after months of app problems. Same issues persisted — crashes and 2FA freezes. Frustration that the society appears to know about the problems but hasn't fixed them.

### Negative - Mortgage paid off but extra payment still taken, can't get through on phones (Trustpilot)
> "I paid off my mortgage with Monmouthshire Building Society, but they still took another full payment afterwards. I could see it showing under my pending transactions and tried calling several times, you simply can't get through on any of the numbers. When someone eventually called me back, they assured me the extra payment wouldn't be taken. And guess what, it was. Now I'm left chasing them again, and getting through is a nightmare."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Date:** November 2025
- **Context:** Long-standing mortgage customer had extra payment taken after redemption despite being assured it wouldn't be. Couldn't reach anyone by phone. "After years of being a customer, I expected much better communication and care."

### Negative - Deposits take days to appear, app is from the Stone Age (Trustpilot)
> "Opened a regular savings account due to the decent percentage, however I'm thinking of closing this to go with another bank because of how glitchy and awful the app is to use. I'm still yet to see my deposit in my account which has been 2 days since I sent this over. The app constantly crashes, it's something out of the Stone Age. Really awful. Wish I hadn't bothered."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Date:** October 2025
- **Context:** Attracted by rates but frustrated by deposits taking days to appear (MBS processes electronic payments via their bank account first, causing delays). App crashes compound the frustration.

### Positive - Excellent support from MBS (Smart Money People)
> "I have had a mortgage with the Monmouthshire BS for 8 years - both during my working life and after retirement. At all times I have been treated with courtesy and given very helpful service from informed and efficient advisers who have shown considerable understanding of my individual situation (I am now 73) and have successfully matched products to my requirements at different times. I have also consulted independent mortgage advisers and visited mortgage comparison websites. On the last 3 occasions I have returned to the Monmouthshire because of their excellence."

### Positive - Fast turnaround, great service from Jamie! (Smart Money People)
> "I contacted MBS about porting my mortgage on a new property purchase. Jamie Warburton picked up the request, and has been nothing but brilliant ever since. Every step of the journey there more than adequate updates, explanations when they were needed, and other relevant information. I really felt like Jamie was on my side, really pled my case with the underwriters to get the mortgage offer over the line. For a process that has generally been quite stressful in the past, Jamie made it a lot less so, on top of probably a record time turnaround."

### Positive - Brilliant Mortgage Advisor (Smart Money People)
> "Our experience from start to finish couldn’t have been better. Whilst there was a lot of information to go through, our mortgage advisor Anita was always there to answer any questions. Even though we had to go through some difficult questions regarding our finances it never felt like we were being judged, Anita was so professional and supportive which made the whole process as stress free as possible."

### Negative - App would not take info given (Smart Money People)
> "App would not take the information given to start the account and kept getting messages to call the BS. Cust service told me to delete app and reload but same problems. Cust service tried to sort out but couldn’t. 4th attempt and a few days later, finally got it sorted. Also app tells you to call the BS between 9and 5 but seems to forget they don’t open until 10 on Wednesdays for their sleep in."

### Positive - One of the good B Societies (Smart Money People)
> "I have been a regular customer of the building society for the last 3 years benefiting from best Savings rates. I have sometimes used customer services with good outcomes . The app service introduced is useful. It would have been convenient to access closed accounts for interest for self assessment. HOPE MY REQUEST FOR THE PAPER COPY FOR YEAR 2024-25 would be complied with Thanks"

### Positive - Be open to advice (Smart Money People)
> "As retired Corporate bankers Ian and I thought we knew all that we needed to about mortgages but we were wrong!! Anita was extremely knowledgeable and helpful in explaining why we were able to fix the rate for a longer term than we had expected and the amount we can repay early without penalty. Both of these have resulted in a far better outcome for us than we had hoped for."
