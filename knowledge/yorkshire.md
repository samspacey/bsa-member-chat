## Specific Trustpilot Reviews

The following are real customer reviews from Trustpilot (uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.ybs.co.uk), selected for their specificity and story-like detail. These can inform simulated member conversations.

### Positive - Kingston branch goes above and beyond on home insurance
> "Going into my local branch in Kingston is always a great experience. You are welcomed as if you are Family. I was helped by David who gave outstanding customer care. As I was leaving, David asked if I needed Home insurance. He arranged for Uinsure to call me the next day. Yorkshire Building Society did not make a penny on that transaction. The commission that they would have earned they in fact request is passed on to their customer to significantly lower their premium! Uinsure confirmed that Yorkshire are literally the only ones who do this by foregoing their commission 100%. While being there I also noticed that they knew their regular customers by name. It was like stepping back in time to when the world was a much better place."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** Long-term member praises Kingston branch staff by name; highlights YBS's zero-commission home insurance model and the personal, old-fashioned feel of branch banking

### Positive - Warrington branch ISA opening with tea and coffee
> "We walked into the Warrington branch to talk about and open 2 cash ISAs. We had a short wait but were offered tea and coffee. The staff were extremely helpful, the service we received was just what we wanted and the whole experience was friendly and trouble free."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** Couple opening ISAs in branch; highlights hospitality and relaxed atmosphere

### Positive - Welcome phone call from a real person
> "Easy to navigate website made opening an account straightforward. Follow up phone call from an actual person welcoming me as a member was pleasantly surprising."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** New member surprised by personal welcome call after joining online — a distinctive YBS touch

### Positive - Passbooks helping with disability and memory issues
> "Great staff, helpful with people who have a disability. Books are a brilliant thing instead of a card to keep up with payments and no pin numbers to key in, especially when you have memory issues putting in a number you forgot."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** Customer with memory/disability issues values passbooks as an accessible alternative to cards and PINs — speaks to financial inclusion

### Positive - Couple's ISA opened seamlessly, staff did everything
> "Opened a new cash ISA without any problems at all. Then helped my wife open one too by transferring an existing cash ISA she had with an alternative bank. They did it all for us."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** Branch staff handled full ISA transfer from another provider on the spot for a couple

### Positive - Exeter branch and the passbook feeling
> "Lovely colleague sorted our 2 new accounts, explained everything clearly. A nice feeling when entering building society in Exeter branch. And given passbooks which we will update soon."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** New accounts opened in branch; customer values the tangible passbook and the atmosphere of a building society

### Negative - Lasting Power of Attorney nightmare for 97-year-old
> "I recently tried to register a Lasting Power of Attorney with the YBS for my 97 year old father using the Kingston Upon Thames branch. All the paperwork was completed and checked by the staff at the branch for completeness. A couple of days later I was informed by telephone that the ID provided by my brother who lives in Portugal was not sufficient. After several attempts at providing pretty much all the ID he possessed we gave up. It was like dealing with robots, no empathy, no pragmatism."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** Family managing elderly father's affairs frustrated by rigid ID requirements for overseas relatives; "like dealing with robots" is a recurring phrase in LPA complaints

### Negative - First-time buyer rejected after multiple reassurances
> "As a first time buyer I had come to YBS for my AIP as reviews in the whole area were good. I called the 'mortgage advisors' and was told 'we cannot advise you and we really are not able to discuss particulars of each mortgage.' I completed the full application. I received a telephone call today advising 'sorry we don't mortgage a flat, it's just policy but we can keep your account open if you want to choose another house.' Firstly this is not a pair of shoes — it's not as simple as picking another — it's the house I will live in for the rest of my life. Really disappointing that at no point going through all of this information 3 times did someone think to mention it was all a huge waste of time."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Date:** November 2025
- **Context:** First-time buyer went through entire online mortgage process only to be told the property type wasn't eligible; criticises execution-only model and lack of proactive guidance

### Negative - £35k ISA deposit mix-up
> "Went to open cash ISA with my £20k and assistant said 'anything else sir?' I said yes I have another £15k. 'Oh right I will open an account for that too' — and my bank details were taken. Next day £35k went out of my account and the following day it returned. I enquired and a person on the desk said max in ISA is £20k. I know, I replied — the rest was to go into this account. 'Sorry sir.' I left and went elsewhere."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Date:** April 2025
- **Context:** Branch staff error caused £35k to bounce back; customer lost trust and moved money to a competitor

### Negative - Online banking described as unusable
> "I might have an instant access saver but who cares if you can't log on! I've had maybe 20 accounts in my years and YBS has been the worst to deal with in terms of access. Almost every time I try to use YBS online or via app it costs me a couple hours of the day going through their archaic systems which are often broken!"
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** Experienced saver compares YBS unfavourably to every other bank they've used; highlights repeated login difficulties

### Negative - LPA bureaucracy described as worst in UK
> "I have Lasting Power of Attorney for a relative and have been slowly gaining access to her bank accounts. I have gone through the process with Nationwide, Barclays, Halifax, Coventry, MBNA and Yorkshire — and the most bureaucratic and unhelpful by a large margin is YBS. They demand loads of personal information but will not explain why they need it. They seem obsessed with their policies and become very defensive when those policies are questioned. It is like dealing with robots. They are now stating it will take up to 8 weeks to 'investigate.'"
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Date:** November 2025
- **Context:** Person with LPA compared experience across six financial institutions; YBS rated worst by far. Updated review to note that YBS's response was an automated reply, reinforcing the "robots" criticism

### Negative - Offset mortgage app like 1990s banking
> "Transferred my offset mortgage from Scottish Widows and it's like going back to banking in the 1990s. Payments out go through the next day whereas all modern offsets are same day. One can't even schedule a future payment or make recurring payments. The app is so basic all you can do is pay out and then only the next day. The App doesn't allow one to track monthly interest for the mortgage and offset credit — it just posts amounts with no detail. I wish I hadn't moved. Their insistence on unnecessarily keeping my money for an extra day when no other bank I use does the same — it's made worse as they debit the offset instantly so I lose a day's worth of offset but don't receive my money until the next day."
- **Rating:** 2/5
- **Date:** September 2025
- **Context:** Mortgage customer who moved specifically for lower rates found the technology so poor they regret switching; detailed critique of next-day transfers, lack of scheduling, and opaque interest reporting

### Mixed - "Easy access" ISA stress during house completion
> "Generally good, but got 'stung' when I wanted same-day access to my 'easy-access ISA' savings towards a house completion. Unlike other easy-access accounts I've used, I had to wait until next day for my YBS transfer to reach my external account. It would be helpful if they changed the title from 'easy access' to 'next day access by close of business', to avoid panic. Luckily my transfer arrived at 9am — approximately 27 hours after my instruction — on the crucial day. But until that point, I was a bit stressed, to say the least."
- **Rating:** 3/5
- **Date:** October 2025
- **Context:** Customer nearly missed a house completion because "easy access" actually meant next-day transfer; YBS responded saying same-day transfers are coming soon

### Mixed - ISA renewal rate lower than website offer
> "I have been a Yorkshire customer for the past 2 years with a fixed rate ISA. I have just received a letter with a renewal offer of 3.5% for the next two years. I checked the website where the current rate for such an investment is 3.9%. Why do they not want my money anymore? My previous experience has been fine but I am now VERY disappointed with them."
- **Rating:** 2/5
- **Date:** October 2025
- **Context:** Loyal member offered a worse rate on renewal than new customers get online — a common frustration in savings across the industry, but felt as a betrayal by a mutual

### Mixed - Couple's ISAs accidentally swapped
> "My wife and I came in to open 2 ISA accounts — one a fixed rate ISA for myself and an easy access ISA for my wife. We ended up getting an easy access account for me and a fixed rate account for my wife, not sure how this happened. Didn't like the constant push to sell us different types of insurance. Also wasn't impressed that we were asked to leave a good review."
- **Rating:** 2/5
- **Date:** December 2025
- **Context:** Branch staff mixed up which product was for which spouse; also highlights insurance cross-selling and explicit review solicitation
