## History

The West Brom has a rich 175+ year history:

- **1849:** Founded at Paradise Street Methodist Meeting rooms, West Bromwich. Original 20 members were local tradesmen — retailers, boat builder, boot maker, blacksmith, glass cutter
- **Early years:** Very local society focused on enabling working men to own homes. Growth was slow — assets grew from £170k to £209k between 1879-1909
- **Inter-war period:** Substantial growth from £0.3m to £3.8m by 1939. Dominated West Bromwich — 75% of town's mortgages in 1928
- **1928:** First branches opened in Smethwick, Oldbury, and Tipton (initially part-time, three days a week)
- **1958-1978 (Dilkes era):** Transformation from local to major regional society under Frank Dilkes. Expanded to 67 branches covering Midlands, Shropshire, North Wales, Hampshire, and Bedfordshire. Assets grew past £100m
