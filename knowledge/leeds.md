- **Mortgage disputes:** Rare but intense negative reviews around mortgage product changes during relationship breakdowns, and accessibility/discrimination concerns
- **Review Centre rating:** Much lower scores on Review Centre (a smaller sample, 33 reviews with ~1.4/5 average), though this reflects a self-selecting audience of complainers and is not representative

## Specific Trustpilot Reviews

These are real reviews from Trustpilot (uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.leedsbuildingsociety.co.uk), curated to show the range of member experiences. Overall rating: 4.8/5 from 6,200+ reviews.

### Positive - Mortgage advisor made a stressful process feel easy
> "I had an excellent experience with this mortgage adviser Kali. They were extremely helpful throughout the entire process, explaining everything clearly and making what could have been a stressful situation feel straightforward and manageable. Their professionalism, knowledge, and ongoing support really stood out, and I always felt confident that I was in safe hands. I couldn't recommend them highly enough."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Date:** February 2026
- **Context:** Member praised named mortgage advisor for turning a daunting process into a smooth experience. Typical of the very common "named staff praise" pattern.

### Positive - Patient guidance through the "mortgage maze"
> "I spoke to Ben today when I asked about making my way through the mortgage maze. He was professional and knowledgeable and was able to answer all my questions. I was impressed by his patience and willingness to ensure I understood all the legalities. It was a very informative call, thank you Ben and LBS."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Date:** February 2026
- **Context:** Phone-based mortgage inquiry. Reviewer valued the patience and thoroughness of explanation, especially around legal aspects.

### Positive - Easiest call during a difficult week
> "Spoke to Alex Johnsen today at Leeds Building Society. This week has been quite difficult sorting things out over the phone, but have to say this was the easiest and most pleasant conversation I have had. A big thank you for listening and sorting out our needs, a pleasure doing business. Really happy with the service."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Date:** February 2026
- **Context:** Member had been dealing with multiple institutions and found LBS the most pleasant to deal with. Highlights the "human touch" that distinguishes LBS from larger institutions.

### Positive - Branch staff never rush you
> "Lisa who served us was exceptional. She explained things very clearly, was so patient, and never rushed us. Lisa was polite and friendly and a credit to Leeds BS."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Date:** February 2026
- **Context:** In-branch experience. Short but specific praise for patience and clear explanations — a recurring theme across hundreds of positive reviews.

### Positive - Feeling looked after and understood
> "I feel very looked after by Leeds and their products seem competitive. Kerry and Debbie have both been very kind and personable during our phone calls, never minding going over something until I understood it."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Date:** February 2026
- **Context:** Member valued the willingness of staff to repeat explanations without impatience. Reflects the emotional "looked after" sentiment common in positive LBS reviews.

### Positive - Outstanding customer service rescued a tech problem from New Zealand
> "I am currently on holiday in New Zealand and needed help with my online accounts. Tommy Wilson in your head office customer service team was absolutely brilliant at getting back to me and sorting out any issues I had. He sent me several e-mails in a timely manner until he resolved everything. Thank you so much Tommy! Best customer service person I have yet to encounter. Restored my faith in LBS online, which isn't the most advanced from a tech point of view! In fact it could perhaps do with bringing into 2026 in a more sophisticated way."
- **Rating:** 4/5
- **Date:** October 2025
- **Context:** Even this positive review acknowledges tech shortcomings but shows how strong personal service compensates. Staff member went above and beyond across time zones.

### Mixed - Good ethics, clunky tech, money disappears faster than it returns
> "I like the company ethics, the financial offer is decent, and the customer service is excellent. The online banking is a little clunky since there isn't an app, plus for some reason, there is no flexibility with the two-step verification — mobile text or nothing, where other banks can offer emails as alternatives if you don't have the signal. I'm also a little frustrated that when I deposit money it's accepted instantly, but when I withdraw it takes more than 24 hours, despite losing interest from the moment I request it."
- **Rating:** 4/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** Captures the classic LBS tension: great values and people, but digital experience lags behind competitors. The asymmetry of instant deposits vs slow withdrawals is a common frustration.

### Mixed - Easy to deposit, hard to get money back
> "Over a year ago I opened an ISA account online. Today I wanted to move my funds back to my bank account. After entering the details of my nominated account online I got an email: 'as your account isn't an online based account, we aren't able to add your requested nominated account... you can withdraw funds in CASH in a BRANCH, by CHEQUE or internal transfer in a BRANCH or via POST.' BRANCH (30 miles away), CASH, CHEQUE, POST... are unacceptable options. Update: Phone staff are very kind and helpful, they added my nominated account with no fuss."
- **Rating:** 4/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** Illustrates the friction of withdrawals vs deposits. The update shows that phone support resolved the issue easily — but the online self-service gap is the frustration.

### Mixed - Password nightmare saga ending with resolution
> "Okay, no app so create account on internet, wait 3 days for post pin and all ready to login in using the ridiculous username it made me use with special character and 20 digit password followed by several security questions. Finally activate account, deposit £25k then tried to login again, and message error in password. Spend 25 mins on phone, helper confirmed password work for him! Tried 3 separate devices and finally gave up... 15 mins later I asked what my username was and guess what, it had been truncated following account activation and was two digits shorter. Couldn't write it. Anyway, nice British helpers and finally logged in and £25k on dashboard. Very stressful."
- **Rating:** 3/5
- **Date:** June 2025
- **Context:** Exemplifies the online banking pain points: no app, complex credentials, system bugs. But even frustrated members acknowledge staff are "nice" and "helpful."

### Mixed - Locked out, closed account in 30 seconds, then got a hamper
> "Still unable to Logon or reset password, still locked out of account. Rang helpline again. Nice lady tried to help, but all that could be advised would be that it may be 72 hours before I could get back into account. At that point I gave up! I asked if my account could be closed. Yes! Took about 30 seconds for money to be transferred to my nominated account! I must ask, why was it going to take days to re-establish access my account yet only 30 seconds to close it. I am dumfounded! End of Story, Thursday. Yesterday, received a personal call from Leeds BSOC Customer Management. Discussed at length the problems I had experienced. Nice lady had a genuine desire to improve their system. Even sent me a nice hamper for my troubles."
- **Rating:** 3/5
- **Date:** February 2025
- **Context:** Remarkable story arc: days of frustration → account closed in 30 seconds → personal callback and a hamper. Shows both the systemic tech failings and the genuinely caring recovery response.

### Negative - Getting money out feels like 1972
> "I was tempted by class leading savings interest rates advertised on social media which makes you think they are on the ball, but there is no app and getting your money out is like going back to 1972. I transferred money out of my Cahoot savings at 8.30pm and it was in my current account less than a minute later. Doing the same with Leeds on Wednesday at 8.30pm means you don't see your money until Friday at the earliest. Mrs Jones has to go and see Mr Smith in the accounts office I suspect who stamps the authorisation in triplicate and no doubt sends a 1 shilling post office telegram to head office to release the money. Positively archaic."
- **Rating:** 2/5
- **Date:** April 2025
- **Context:** Colourful and widely-relatable review highlighting the contrast between competitive rates and antiquated withdrawal processes. The satirical tone captures a common sentiment.

### Negative - Stranded abroad with no access to money
> "I am in The Gambia and apparently I cannot access my online account because I am in The Gambia. Despite ringing and writing no-one has offered any constructive help and after a month of trying I still cannot access MY MONEY from MY ACCOUNT. The service has been appalling especially when compared to other financial institutions who have rung me and written to me and in general behaved with respect and understanding over my situation. But not the Leeds who are quite happy to let me starve out here rather than give me MY MONEY!"
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Date:** November 2025
- **Context:** Member abroad unable to access accounts for a month. Highlights the geo-blocking/access issues and the gap between LBS's typically good phone service and this member's experience of being ignored.

### Negative - Disability discrimination allegation in mortgage application
> "My brother, who has autism and a mild learning disability, recently applied for a mortgage. He has full mental capacity, a stable job, and is fully able to make his own financial decisions. Despite this, Leeds Building Society refused to lend to him unless he put a Power of Attorney in place, essentially insisting that someone else take legal control of his financial affairs. This was incredibly upsetting and felt wholly inappropriate. Having autism or a learning disability does not mean someone lacks capacity. Leeds offered no proper explanation for this decision, no evidence that a POA was necessary, and we were simply told their refusal was 'final.' Edit: I emailed Alex — he never replied! Says it all really. AVOID!!"
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Date:** December 2025
- **Context:** Serious allegation of disability discrimination in mortgage lending. LBS responded offering to investigate, but the reviewer says the follow-up email was never answered. One of the most concerning negative reviews.

### Negative - Branch gave wrong information about Child Trust Fund transfer
> "Visited the Huddersfield branch to deposit money and ask about the procedure of transferring a Child Trust Fund held at LBS to a Junior Cash ISA. The gentleman then proceeded to tell us that it wasn't possible to transfer the CTF and that we would have to wait until it matured. I had already researched the subject and so knew it was possible but as LBS don't offer a Junior ISA I wanted to know the procedure. The gentleman was adamant there was nothing we could do. I have since set up a Junior Cash ISA elsewhere and am about to start the transfer of the CTF. This really is very poor from LBS."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Date:** December 2025
- **Context:** Staff confidently provided incorrect information, potentially costing the member years of better returns. Illustrates occasional knowledge gaps in branches on less common products.

### Negative - ISA rate slashed weeks after opening
> "I absolutely hate to leave a 2 star but on two occasions now, I have applied for an ISA and banked my money only to have an email from Leeds BS, only 4 weeks after, to say the interest rate has been slashed. It is simply a con and I won't be banking my very hard earned savings like this again."
- **Rating:** 2/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** Variable rate ISA rate cuts shortly after account opening. Member felt misled. Reflects broader frustration when attractive headline rates change quickly on variable products.
