## History

- Founded in 1922 with head office at 24 Queen Street, Manchester
- In March 2007, the society bought Whiteaway Laidlaw Bank from Home Retail Group
- In February 2011, Whiteaway Laidlaw Bank was sold to private investors led by RBS Equity Finance (later Pollen Street Capital)
- **2013:** After concerns about capital adequacy, the society **ceased lending to customers** — a significant turning point
- The society took its former auditor, Grant Thornton, to court claiming negligence that caused the capitalisation concerns
- In late 2018, the court awarded a negligible sum versus the initial claim, and Manchester BS was forced to pay Grant Thornton's costs
- In June 2021, the Supreme Court overturned the lower court's decision in the landmark case *Manchester Building Society v Grant Thornton LLP [2021] UKSC 20*
- **February 2023:** Announced agreement to merge with Newcastle Building Society
- **1 July 2023:** Merger completed by transfer of engagements. Manchester Building Society became a trading name of Newcastle Building Society
