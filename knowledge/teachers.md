## Community & Values

- **Core purpose:** Helping every teacher across England and Wales to make home ownership a reality
- **Founded on social justice:** In the 1960s, teachers (especially women) were considered unattractive lending prospects by high street providers. The NUT created the society to change this.
- **100% teacher-first:** Everything the society does comes back to supporting teacher homeownership
- **Colleague volunteering:** Each team member gets up to two working days per year for community/charitable work
- **Community activities include:**
  - Volunteering in education settings
  - Foodbank drives and donations
  - Providing advice on job applications and personal finance through school partnerships
  - Beach cleans for cleaner coastlines
  - Tree planting and woodland regeneration
- **Environmental commitment:** Use of Ecosia as default search engine, energy-efficient lighting, reduced paper usage
- **Sustainability guide:** Published eco-friendly home living tips for teacher members

## Key Differentiators

2. **Up to 7x income lending** — Significantly higher than typical high street limits, recognising teacher income stability
3. **Understanding of teacher careers** — Accepts NQTs, supply teachers, contract workers, and retirees; understands term-time working patterns
4. **Purpose-driven mutual** — Founded to solve a social problem (teacher homeownership); purpose hasn't changed in nearly 60 years
5. **Savings directly fund teacher mortgages** — Clear mutual link between saving and lending
6. **Small, personal service** — ~50-80 staff means genuine individual attention
7. **Branchless model** — Lower overheads allow competitive rates and focus on core mission
8. **Buyers Club** — Sign-up programme to help prospective teacher buyers prepare for homeownership
