## Customer Sentiment (from reviews/Trustpilot)

### Trustpilot Rating
- **2.2 out of 5** (from ~63 reviews) — rated "Poor"
- Very low review volume on Trustpilot; not representative of broader customer sentiment

### Feefo Rating (primary review platform used by Cumberland)
- **4.8 out of 5** (from 4,553+ reviews)
- **Platinum Trusted Service Award** — 5 consecutive years
- 90%+ gave maximum 5 stars; 98% gave 4 or 5 stars
- Over 2,000 verified reviews in the last year alone

### Smart Money People
- **4.72-4.73 out of 5** (from 46-48 reviews)
- Mortgage products particularly well-rated (4.65/5)

### App Store Ratings
- **iOS:** 4.8 stars (1,300+ ratings)
- **Android:** 4.3 stars (520+ reviews)

### Positive Themes
- **Outstanding personal service** — staff consistently praised as friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, and warm
- **Branch experience** — valued for maintaining physical presence; customers appreciate speaking to real people
- **Mortgage expertise** — specialist knowledge (holiday lets, self-employed, later life); qualified advisers
- **Community feel** — strong sense of being part of the local community; staff go above and beyond
- **Vulnerability support** — colleagues check on vulnerable customers, delivered shopping during Covid
- **Relationship banking** — named contacts, personal approach, "common sense" lending decisions
- **Local identity** — strong Cumbrian brand that resonates with regional customers

### Negative Themes
- **Technology frustrations** — slow payment processing (hours for transfers), salary not showing until head office opens, systems described as "outdated" and "archaic"
- **ISA maturity process** — complaints about auto-renewal being difficult to opt out of; transfer processes described as cumbersome
- **Limited phone support capability** — front-line staff described as lovely but unable to resolve many issues; callbacks from specialist teams unreliable
- **Executive pay concerns** — some criticism of CEO/CFO compensation relative to service levels
- **Digital gaps** — some savings products lack internet/app management; cheque-only withdrawals on some accounts criticised
- **Security checks** — frequent, repetitive automated security calls perceived as excessive
- **AML/KYC processes** — some business customers found anti-money laundering checks intrusive and disruptive (account blocking)

### Sentiment Summary
The stark contrast between Trustpilot (2.2/5, low volume) and Feefo (4.8/5, high volume) suggests that Trustpilot captures a self-selecting minority of frustrated customers, while the broader customer base is highly satisfied. The technology complaints are consistent across platforms and are being addressed by the New Cumberland transformation. Branch and personal service receive near-universal praise.

## Community & Values

### Purpose & Ethos
- **"Kinder banking. It's in our nature."** — core brand positioning
- Three pillars: **People** (welcoming, respectful banking), **Planet** (nurturing the countryside), **Community** (building stronger communities)
- Mutually owned — 100% of profits reinvested into the business and communities
- **Donates 1.5% of profits** to good causes
- Targeting **carbon neutral in operations by 2030**

### Key Community Initiatives
- **Kinder Kind of Kitchen:** Major food poverty programme in partnership with FareShare Lancashire & Cumbria and FareShare Glasgow & West of Scotland. £250,000 annual donation; delivered 577,047 meal equivalents in first year.

- **10th best large employer in UK** (2025, up from 17th in 2024, 67th previously)
- 2nd best in Scotland, 2nd in financial services nationally
- Highest-ranked building society nationally
- 89% colleague survey response rate; anonymous feedback
- **Diversity & Inclusion:** Women occupy 50% of senior roles; first female chair appointed 2024-25; Belonging inclusion strategy; neurodiversity and menopause support programmes

### Environmental Commitments

- Carbon footprint reduction programme
- Carbon neutral operations target by 2030
- Environmental considerations integrated into decision-making
- B Corp certification (January 2026) validates environmental and social practices

## Key Differentiators

1. **Deep regional identity:** The only significant financial institution headquartered in Cumbria; over 175 years of continuous service to the region. Design, branding, and branch aesthetics reflect the Cumbrian landscape (Lake District, sandstone, wildlife)

2. **Branch commitment in a closing era:** Actively investing in and refurbishing branches while competitors close them; 31 branches maintained with a "branch of our future" vision

3. **Holiday let & hospitality specialism:** Unique expertise in holiday let mortgages and hospitality lending, reflecting the Lake District tourism economy — a niche most high-street lenders don't serve well

4. **B Corp certified mutual:** First building society in the North to achieve B Corp certification (January 2026); combines mutual ownership with verified ethical business practices

5. **"Kinder banking" purpose:** Genuine, lived brand values around kindness — not just marketing. Evidenced by food poverty work (£250k/year), wildlife conservation, community education, and colleague wellbeing investment

6. **Award-winning employer:** Consistently ranked among UK's best employers (Top 10 large companies, 3-star world-class); 50% women in senior roles; strong recruitment and retention proposition

7. **Ambitious tech transformation:** TCS BaNCS core banking partnership represents one of the most significant technology investments by a top-10 building society; acknowledges legacy shortcomings and is investing heavily despite short-term profit impact

8. **Full-service regional proposition:** Unusually broad for a building society — personal and business current accounts, motor finance, home insurance, commercial lending alongside traditional savings and mortgages

9. **High customer satisfaction (Feefo):** 4.8/5 across 4,500+ reviews; Platinum Trusted Service Award 5 years running; 98% rating 4+ stars — among the highest in the building society sector

10. **Relationship-managed commercial banking:** Named contacts, common-sense lending approach for hospitality, healthcare, food & drink, and professional services — filling a gap left by big bank centralisation in rural areas

- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Source:** Smart Money People
- **Date:** March 2022
- **Context:** Later-life mortgage applicants found Cumberland willing to lend when many lenders refuse older borrowers — reflects Cumberland's specialist later-life/retirement mortgage capability

### Positive - Mortgage team went above and beyond during health crisis (Trustpilot)
> "I recently experienced health problems and The Cumberland Postal Mortgage Team have been excellent every time I have had contact with them. I have mainly spoken to Ryan (Team Manager) and Sandra (Collections) who have both been very understanding and gone out of their way to accommodate my circumstances which has been amazing. I know not all Mortgage Companies would go out of their way and provide a professional, yet personalised service to react to my current situation."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Source:** Trustpilot
- **Date:** October 2019
- **Context:** Long-standing mortgage customer (8 years) experienced health problems; named staff members Ryan and Sandra in the Postal Mortgage Team provided empathetic, personalised support

### Positive - Same mortgage advisor from first call to moving in (Trustpilot)
> "From the first call to moving in the Cumberland kept me informed about my application, best part was being able to speak to the same person for the whole time — Thank you"
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Source:** Smart Money People
- **Date:** March 2022
- **Context:** First-time buyer experience highlighting Cumberland's relationship model of keeping the same named contact throughout the mortgage journey

### Positive - Fraud sorted three times in one year (Trustpilot)
> "I have been a victim of fraud 3 times in a year now and every time the Cumberland have been fantastic at sorting it out. As you can imagine it was a very upsetting experience but the staff were reassuring and I had money refunded or attempted transactions stopped. Staff are always friendly in my local branch and it gives me peace of mind that the bank is so vigilant about fraud."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Source:** Trustpilot
- **Date:** June 2023
- **Context:** Customer acknowledges slow transfer speeds but praises Cumberland's fraud response — sorted money back each of three times. Also praised the updated mobile app

### Positive - Waived overdraft interest during COVID when Nationwide didn't (Trustpilot)
> "They have truly proven they're a proper building society and want to look after their members. They have waived overdraft interest during this difficult time with Coronavirus. The Nationwide are still charging customers 18/19% and are not showing the considerate thoughts that a building society should. Well done Cumberland. You've earned a fan today."
- **Rating:** 4/5
- **Source:** Trustpilot
- **Date:** May 2020
- **Context:** Customer had previously been let down by Cumberland (withdrawn ISA) but wrote a positive review after they waived overdraft interest during COVID — contrasted favourably with Nationwide

### Positive - Last bank in town, open 6 days a week (Trustpilot)
> "Unlike the big banks that have largely abandoned customers, we are delighted to have a local bank that is open 6 days a week and where the staff seem happy to see you. Convenient current account and top ISA rate."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Source:** Smart Money People
- **Date:** January 2024
- **Context:** Highlights Cumberland's branch commitment in an era of closures; customer values physical access and friendly staff — a recurring positive theme

### Negative - 20-year loyal customer's mortgage nightmare, offered £50 (Trustpilot)
> "I had been a loyal CBS customer for say the past 20 years... The whole process was a nightmare from start to finish, extremely stressful took 3x longer than I was told to complete, they were as much use as an ashtray on a motorbike, the stress they caused me was ridiculous and to add insult to injury they had the cheek to offer me '£50' as a 'gesture of good will' I politely declined... Every few weeks I seem to have an issue with something to do with the Cumberland. They have massively gone down hill and I would never recommend them to anyone which is a shame as I always have done in the past."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Source:** Trustpilot
- **Date:** January 2023
- **Context:** Long-standing customer returned to Cumberland after a period with TSB; mortgage process was deeply stressful. Now empties wages into Chase immediately. Solicitor reportedly "groaned" at Cumberland being the lender in a separate review from another customer

### Negative - Bond maturity: "It's not 1972" (Trustpilot)
> "Bond matured, wanted to withdraw. Can't withdraw until a month after the one anniversary of opening the bond account. It's like it's thirty years ago. No app, no internet — you have to write to them or go in branch. No bank transfer available. Cheque only. Of course the bank I want it to go to doesn't accept cheques as it's 2024. The poor staff at branch are victims of the Cumberland as much as the customers having to deal with this archaic nonsense. Sort yourselves out, Cumberland, it's not 1972."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Source:** Trustpilot
- **Date:** December 2024
- **Context:** Savings bond withdrawal could only be done by cheque or in-branch — no digital option. Customer sympathises with branch staff who are constrained by outdated systems. Illustrates the technology gap the New Cumberland transformation aims to fix

### Negative - Nearly lost retirement investment due to maturity delays (Trustpilot)
> "Getting hold of your own money when a savings account matures is a huge challenge to say the least. I almost lost a retirement investment because of the Cumberland's lack of urgency and due to their inflexibility. The customer service people whilst pleasant are largely clueless. The financial advisors never call back despite promises made to do so. I've banked with this company for 9 years but not for much longer. What on earth has happened to the Cumberland? I used to praise them to the skies and recommend them to other bank users. No more."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Source:** Trustpilot
- **Date:** May 2025
- **Context:** 9-year customer describing a pattern of decline; savings maturity process nearly caused them to lose a retirement investment. Echoes multiple complaints about difficulty accessing money when products mature

### Negative - House purchase transfer missed deadline (Trustpilot)
> "We bought a house and I went into the Cumberland personally to transfer the funds four o'clock the next day still not sorted missed the deadline now going to have to wait another 3 days had to cancel the removal guy and felt very let down going up the town tomorrow to set up with another bank cancel my Cumberland account this isn't the first time they have let me down but it's the last"
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Source:** Trustpilot
- **Date:** April 2024
- **Context:** Customer went into branch in person to initiate a house purchase fund transfer; it wasn't processed in time, causing them to miss the completion deadline and cancel removal arrangements — a high-stakes failure of slow payment processing

### Negative - Bowling club accounts closed without warning (Trustpilot)
> "We as a bowling club have had a current and savings account with our local branch for many, many years. Last month they closed both accounts and sent a cheque for the balance without any warning or contact from them. We have been left with unpaid bills, returned cheques and emails for non payment of direct debits."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Source:** Trustpilot
- **Date:** June 2023
- **Context:** Community bowling club had long-standing accounts closed abruptly with no prior communication, leaving bills unpaid and direct debits bouncing. Likely related to AML/KYC compliance reclassification of club accounts as business accounts

### Negative - ISA auto-renewal trap (Trustpilot)
> "Fixed ISA was coming up for renewal. The maturity letter reminder said you can come into branch if you don't want the ISA to auto renew, otherwise it will auto renew for 12 months. Went into branch and they said you don't need to come in, you just need to transfer ISA to the new provider... Basically was a wasted trip to branch and didn't help me one bit and my ISA was set to auto renew fixed for another year. If you don't want to renew the Cumberland should automatically put you on an easy access ISA, however they don't do this and make it painfully hard to stop the process."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Source:** Trustpilot
- **Date:** December 2024
- **Context:** Customer describes a Catch-22 ISA maturity process: told to visit branch to prevent auto-renewal, but branch couldn't help; transfer timing constraints made it nearly impossible to avoid being locked in for another year. Also claims Feefo reviews are selectively solicited

### Negative - Payments don't show until head office opens (Trustpilot)
> "Payments into account don't show up until head office opens most other banks shows at midnight. After waiting till 8-8.30am for salary or any payment going in, then you have to transfer or pay an account outside of Cumberland and that can take at least 2 hours that is just ridiculous in this day and age. They blocked my application from new bank to do a switch. Leaving me having to manually transfer out straight away."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Source:** Trustpilot
- **Date:** March 2025
- **Context:** Customer since approximately 1990 describing how salary credits don't appear until head office opens (vs midnight at other banks), then outbound transfers take 2+ hours. Also alleges Cumberland blocked a Current Account Switch Service transfer

### Negative - Business account AML demands felt threatening (Trustpilot)
> "We recently received a letter from them demanding that we re-submit identity documents relating to our business account — despite our having submitted all necessary proof of ID when we opened the account nearly 3 years ago... The tone of the letter was officious and at the end threatening. The nature of the threat was that if we didn't supply the information they would 'Put a hold on our account' — 'We don't want to do this, but we may have to.' In other words — do as we want, or we'll close down your company."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Source:** Trustpilot
- **Date:** December 2021
- **Context:** Business customer received AML/KYC re-verification letter they found intrusive, requiring accountant-certified ID documents. The tone was perceived as threatening. This is a recurring theme — Cumberland's regulatory compliance processes are perceived as heavy-handed by business customers

### Positive - Not just a number (Smart Money People)
> "I lobe how personal this building society is. Ive used this bank for as long as I can remember as My Mum has too. They are reliable and always there to help with anything you need or want from a bank. I trust them and would never want to look elsewhere to look after my money. My little boy also has 2 savings accounts now and i hope he chooses the Cumberland when he grows up. Annie"

### Negative - Just awful (Smart Money People)
> "I very much regret taking a mortgage out with this building society. Worst lender I’ve encountered in over 30 years. Customer service is non existant. They want an insane amount of information when it comes to borrowing anything and then tell me that I can’t afford £5k extra on my mortgage even though my salary just increased by £14k. Won’t use the again."
