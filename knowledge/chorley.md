- **TCS BaNCS** for Core Banking — replacing legacy systems

**Known digital challenges:**
- The existing online platform (Chorley Online) receives criticism for being difficult to use, with some users reporting issues completing applications online
- No mobile app (yet) — a significant gap compared to larger societies

- The TCS partnership is expected to address these issues but implementation timelines are not yet public
