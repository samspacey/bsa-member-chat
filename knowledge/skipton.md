## Specific Trustpilot Reviews

*Sourced from uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.skipton.co.uk — selected for specificity and storytelling value.*

### Positive - First mortgage experience, consistently helpful phone support
> "Always been helpful each time I've called for more information and also when we were setting up our first mortgage. Never had someone on the other end of the phone who was disheartening or dismissive, answer all questions I have or concerns. Call wait times always been short too which is a bonus."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** Long-term member praising consistent quality of phone support across multiple interactions, including during their first mortgage process.

### Positive - Dream home made real despite underwriting hiccup
> "You have made our dreams come true! There was a hiccup with the underwriters which was very stressful at the time but now we're moved in it feels all worth it! Thank you for the thoughtful goodie gift box."
- **Rating:** 4/5
- **Date:** November 2025
- **Context:** New mortgage customer who experienced stress during underwriting but was won over by the end result and Skipton's "welcome home" gift box.

### Positive - Accidental LISA transfer reversed without penalty
> "Accidentally transferred money into my Lifetime ISA, contacted to explain the situation and Jasmine got my funds sent back without having to face a withdrawal penalty."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** Member made an accidental deposit into their LISA. Staff member Jasmine was able to reverse it without the usual government withdrawal penalty — a potentially costly mistake resolved quickly.

### Positive - Real humans on web chat, not chatbots
> "Had a query on a savings account so tried the online chat. The call handler wasn't a chatbot which was a good start & she was able to answer my query clearly. Good to deal with in my experience & have decent ethical standards. Savings rates are consistently OK too."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** Member specifically values that Skipton's web chat is staffed by real people, not automated bots. Also praises ethical standards and competitive savings rates.

### Positive - Face-to-face branch service, treated like a valued customer
> "Great service, impartial information, pleasant knowledgeable staff. Treated like a valued customer. Good face to face information — that's what most people want."
- **Rating:** 5/5
- **Date:** February 2026
- **Context:** Branch visit where member felt genuinely valued and appreciated the in-person, impartial advice from knowledgeable staff.

### Positive - Fantastic customer service and good range, but digital needs work
> "The customer service is fantastic and unlike a lot of BS now they have branches all over. Skipton offer good rates as a saver and a good range of products. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is Skipton's online services. The app and website need to be updated — making payments can be awkward, only being able to have 2 nominated accounts rather than payees is again not great. Why you have to pay into a Barclays account first with a reference is beyond me! It can often take hours for this to show in your savings account. Overall Skipton Building Society are fantastic."
- **Rating:** 4/5
- **Date:** July 2025
- **Context:** Balanced review from a satisfied saver who loves the branch network and customer service but highlights specific digital banking frustrations — limited payees, indirect payment routing via Barclays, and slow deposits.

### Negative - Older customer locked out, no smartphone, nearest branch 45 miles away
> "Another company treating customers appallingly for having the temerity to want access to our own money. I do not have a 'smart' phone so can't use the app. I called their 'help' desk, was told to use the app even though I'd explained why I couldn't... Then, I was told to go to a branch even though the nearest is 45 miles away. Note to Skipton, some of us live in the real world where we have to work for a living... As I pointed out to the young man who called me, the way older people are discriminated against is appalling. Update: I have tried this email address to be told by someone called a 'Social Media Community Specialist' (no, me neither) that I will have to email several forms of ID. Furthermore, I was addressed as 'Hi there'. Perhaps Skipton are trying to get down with the kids. This is no way to run a financial institution."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** Customer without a smartphone unable to access their own savings. Repeatedly told to use the app or visit a branch 45 miles away. Raises concerns about digital exclusion and age discrimination. Escalated to CEO before partial resolution.

### Negative - £802/month still being taken for a mortgage that no longer exists
> "I have spoken with their customer services over the period of a month, lodged two complaints and today sent their internal form to complain to their CEO. They keep taking £802 from my bank account for a mortgage I no longer have with them for a house I no longer own. Help! I am being ignored by them for what feels like borderline theft, as they yet again take money that is not theirs."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** Former mortgage customer whose direct debit of £802/month continued being collected after the mortgage was closed and the property sold. Multiple complaints and escalations over a month failed to stop the payments.

### Negative - ISA transfer nightmare with unauthorised fixed-term and £299 penalty threat
> "I invested quite a considerable amount of money with this building society... The first involved an inter-banking transaction where all I needed was the bank's transaction details — it took hours of phone calls and an official complaint to eventually get the information. No one seems to know what they are doing... The next involved a straightforward ISA transfer at the end of a fixed term ISA. Without my authority they transferred it to another fixed term, denied the other finance company sent them paperwork and now state that as it's over the 21 days I would suffer a £299 penalty!! The cheek of it, penalising a customer because they can't do their job properly."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Date:** November 2025
- **Context:** Member experienced two separate failures — one involving a simple inter-bank transfer that required a formal complaint, and another where their ISA was moved to a new fixed term without consent, then threatened with an early withdrawal penalty.

### Negative - Chester branch, 50-mile round trip for a simple transfer, walked out
> "Chester Branch (1 other customer in branch). I asked to move my money from a savings account to an ISA. This could not be done without an appointment on another day. I told the manager that it was a 50-mile round trip from North Wales to the branch and it was not worth the bother. So closed my savings account and got a cheque for 8K to put somewhere else."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Date:** December 2025
- **Context:** Member drove 50 miles round trip to make a simple savings-to-ISA transfer, only to be told they needed a separate appointment. Closed their account on the spot and left with an £8,000 cheque.

### Negative - Locked out of app for a year, phone support useless
> "Awful blippy app, like Fort Knox trying to get your own money. Terrible and stressful, I have been trying to access my account for a YEAR. Phone support useless, they just send out codes in the post that don't work. I HATE THEM."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Date:** December 2025
- **Context:** Customer unable to access their account via the app for an entire year. Repeated attempts at resolution via phone only resulted in posted security codes that didn't work. Extreme frustration and loss of trust.

### Negative - Cheque-only closure, lost 12 days' access to own money
> "I was only offered a cheque when I closed my online savings account. They sent it 2nd class and then I had to wait 2 days for Lloyds to clear it. Overall I lost 12 days access to my money due to this archaic way of paying clients who close an account."
- **Rating:** 1/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** Member closing an online savings account was given no electronic transfer option — only a cheque sent by 2nd class post. Total delay of 12 days before funds were accessible, highlighting an outdated process.

### Negative - Disabled pensioner's 104-mile round trip for Power of Attorney registration
> "I am a 70-plus year old disabled pensioner with glaucoma and who needs 2 sticks to walk. Both my wife and I wished to log our Power of Attorneys with Skipton branch in North Berwick Scotland... North Berwick is a round trip from our home of some 104 miles. So returned with the documents this week to be told that we have to make an appointment and fill in a four-page document! My wife has to fill in forms for me. So misinformation from the branch and again more miles and time required... Various emails back and forth and still no further forward: they suggested I go online but my wife hates computers and we have poor connection where we live."
- **Rating:** 2/5
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Context:** Elderly disabled couple given incorrect information on first branch visit about POA registration requirements. Made a 104-mile round trip only to be told they needed an appointment and additional paperwork. Digital alternatives not viable due to poor connectivity and lack of computer confidence.

### Mixed - 15-year loyal mortgage customer disappointed by misleading savings product
> "I received an email about the Regular Member Saver account and thought the interest rate looked decent. However, it wasn't made clear upfront that this was a fixed-term product. You have to wait a full year until maturity, and any withdrawal before then closes the account entirely... The app itself is clunky, outdated, and actually crashed while I was adding money. This made me worry that the funds might not have gone through... As a loyal mortgage customer with Skipton for 15 years, this experience has left me disappointed and for the first time I am considering moving my mortgage when my deal is up next year."
- **Rating:** 3/5
- **Date:** April 2025
- **Context:** Long-standing 15-year mortgage customer tried a savings product, found the terms misleading, the app crashed during a deposit, and the registration process took 12 days. Now considering leaving altogether — illustrates how a poor savings experience can erode mortgage loyalty.

### Mixed - Great app and web interface, but systematic ISA transfer failures
> "Skipton Building Society has a great app and web interface and offers some good savings accounts... It's very easy to open a new Cash ISA and transfer an existing Cash ISA internally. The Member Bonus Saver pays a good rate. Unfortunately experienced systematic problems transferring Cash ISAs to new providers (now happened twice)... Due to technical anomalies at Skipton, even though the problem is at their end, they ask you to submit another transfer request. Hi Jasmin, why would I want to discuss this further with you? Have System Problem Reports been raised and investigated for root cause analysis?"
- **Rating:** 3/5
- **Date:** December 2025
- **Context:** Technically-minded member appreciates Skipton's digital platform for internal use but has experienced repeated systematic failures when transferring ISAs to other providers. Frustrated that the standard "email us" response doesn't address root cause. Highlights a pattern of ISA transfer issues.
