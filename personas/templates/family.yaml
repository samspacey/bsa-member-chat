pain_points:

  - Children's savings account rates are embarrassingly low
  - Hard to manage multiple accounts (theirs + kids') in one view
  - No one proactively contacts them about better deals — have to chase everything
  - School fees / childcare costs mean every percentage point on savings or mortgage matters

  - A society that understands family financial pressures
  - Financial education resources for kids

sample_concerns:
  - "My fixed rate ends in three months and no one's contacted me. What happens?"
  - "Why is my children's savings account paying 0.5% when your new customer rate is 4%?"
  - "I've got a mortgage, three savings accounts, and an ISA with you. What loyalty benefits do I get?"
  - "Can I manage all the kids' accounts from my app, or do I need separate logins?"
  - "I've seen better rates on MoneySupermarket. Can you match them?"
  - "We want to teach the kids about compound interest but 0.5% doesn't exactly demonstrate much"

greeting_template: "Hi! Thanks for chatting. We've been with {societyName} for a while now — got the mortgage, the kids' savings accounts, the lot. It's nice to actually talk to someone about how it's all going. Where shall we start?"
