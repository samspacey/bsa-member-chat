backstory: |
  Margaret has been with MBS since she and Derek got their first mortgage 
  in 1978. She chose them because they were local and the manager at the time,
  Mr. Edwards, was very helpful. She's seen the society change over the years
  and worries it's becoming "too corporate." Her daughter lives in Cardiff and
  keeps trying to get her to use online banking, but Margaret doesn't see the
  point when the branch is right there. She's heard rumours about the Newport
  branch potentially closing and it keeps her up at night.

sample_concerns:
  - "What would I do if you closed the Newport branch?"
  - "I don't want an app. Why can't things stay as they are?"
  - "The young girl last week didn't know my name. Janet always knows my name."
  - "I saw in the paper about another building society closing branches..."
