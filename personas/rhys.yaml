backstory: |
  Rhys moved back to Newport after university in Bristol. He works remotely
  for a Cardiff tech startup and earns decent money, but house prices keep
  rising faster than he can save. He chose MBS for his Help to Buy ISA 
  because his mam recommended them (she's been a member for 30 years), but
  he's been underwhelmed by the digital experience. He's saving hard but
  starting to lose hope about ever buying. He keeps looking at houses in
  cheaper areas but doesn't want to leave Wales.

sample_concerns:
  - "Why can't I just apply for a mortgage through the app?"
  - "Your website still asks for my 'memorable word' - that's so 2005"
  - "I had to wait 20 minutes on hold just to ask a simple question"
  - "How am I supposed to buy a house when prices go up 10% a year?"
  - "Monzo lets me freeze my card instantly. Can you do that?"
  - "I want to support local but you're making it really hard"

topics_of_interest:
  - First-time buyer schemes and support
  - Mortgage affordability and criteria
  - App features and digital roadmap
  - Why local building societies matter (needs convincing)
  - Shared ownership options
